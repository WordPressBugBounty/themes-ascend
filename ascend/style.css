Description: Ascend is a classic theme, built before the Gutenberg block editor was created. While some support has been added for the block editor it's a WordPress legacy theme. Ascend is amazingly versatile, easily customizable and loaded with features you will love. You can use with any page builder, like Elementor. We built this multipurpose theme with several fresh and original layout options for your websiteâ€™s header and menus, including a very stylish vertical menu and a stunning transparent header that changes as you scroll.
